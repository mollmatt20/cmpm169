			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>After looking through Lecture 5's examples on generative methods, the sample on random walk stuck with me as an interesting concept to experiment with. I proceeded to look through its code and made adjustments for my understanding. The line drawn from random points relatively close from the previous made me think about if there can be a way to make more interesting visuals.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After thinking more about how I can make something original with random walks, I was curious if I can have multiple random walks at the same time. Also, I wanted to see a different algorithm in making random walks, which I relied on ChatGPT with. After transferring this code and making adjustments to have two random walks occur at the same time, it gave me an idea that I can have more spawn overtime. Instead of having one created after a certain amount of time, another appears when a certain color-coded one draws over a different color. I was thinking that I need a way to store points in order to track if they have been jotted down, which ChatGPT helped me with.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To reach my idea, I had the random walk process be its own function and simply made another for the other (ie. randomWalk1() and randomWalk2()). I used ChatGPT's inclusion to the point tracker, as well. Then, I implemented another function called checkPoint() to indicate if a point has been already drawn by another random walk. It prints a message to notify that both random walks met, since I was testing it out. I included another random walk function to be spawned at the intersection point of the first two. In draw(), I included an “intersected” flag to start the new random walk if checkForIntersection() has spotted an intersection and to not call for that function again. Also, I adjusted the code to have the random walk be more random in their steps than what ChatGPT suggests. I polished my project to have less lines of code by having a dedicated function to create random walks instead of one for each walk. The doRandomWalk() function will assign the local variables to its respective x and y values, add a random value to each, creating a new vector of the new point and pushing it into the walk’s array, and drawing the vector onto the canvas. I included another random walk to be created based on green intersecting with red, but this time producing an orange color. I adjusted my code to use Math.round() on the random values to be more consistent in visualizing the intersection of random walks.	</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this project, I contributed all of the work with the assistance of ChatGPT and the random walk algorithm from the Generative methods lecture. I first started with the algorithm from the lecture to try to understand how it works and how I can make something original out of it. ChatGPT’s interpretation of random walk was also an inspiration, and I would build off of this. I thought of my original idea, but was stuck on how I would implement it. The AI tool assisted me in finding an approach of saving points in order to compare other points to spawn another random walk by utilizing arrays. The rest of the process went more smoothly, especially after implementing the function for comparing points. More experimentation eventually led to more optimization and less lines of code.</p>
