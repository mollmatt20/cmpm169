			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I’m basing on my inspiration from the two teapot examples in lecture. I was thinking about making 3D objects doing a circle formation, so the examples above can assist me in learning about how to apply multiple 3D objects and how they would rotate on screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>From the teapot in the twister example, I had the code to only rotate the objects around the z-axis and it gave me the circle formation I was looking for. I wonder how I can have the rotation speed be faster than it is now.After finding out that changing the value within rotateZ() will increase the speed of rotation, I implemented the teapot class with its property to the teapot in the sky example. This helps me visualize more of the algorithm, and wondering how I can place each pot at a specific location on the canvas.When approaching the idea of placing multiple teapots at specific locations of the canvas, the teapot in the twister example gives me the method of assigning each pot as a value in a list where I can go through each to put them on the canvas. The positions were found out by testing what vectors will place each pot, so it might change when I choose my own model.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I wasn’t sure what to include in my experiment besides having the models in the circle motion. I tried to see what it would look like with all axes being rotated and filling each model with fill color. To fit the teapot theme, I thought of including a commercial about tea on the canvas. I was able to find an old commercial of Tetley Tea from 1998 and downloaded through the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/tetley-tea-commercial-1998. I uploaded it to my workspace and implemented createVideo() with looping, but it doesn’t seem to work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I contributed the whole experiment with the help of the mentioned examples from the lecture on 3D Graphics. I felt like the learning process was easy to grapple on to, but I was still having trouble trying to implement more creativity to the piece. The circle formation was a start, but I wasn’t sure what to implement next. What also didn’t help was that I didn’t feel well these past days and was trying to catch up on other projects. I’m responsible for my work, and next time I need to put more effort into future experiments. However, I at least attempted to put a video on the canvas to portray the absurdity of the spinning teapots. The video is playing, but no visuals are popping out.</p>
