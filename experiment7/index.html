			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammar & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I want to experiment with tracery grammar and how I can implement some interactivity to it. After the lecture on Grammar and Text Art, I learned more about tracery grammar from this site: http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html</p>
				<p>Additionally, the lecture’s demonstration on the subject and an example from the Generative Design site that changes the font size based on the mouse’s position gave me a foundation of how I should implement my plan. I was thinking if I can have tracery grammar appear from the mouse; having sentences or phrases being traced by the mouse.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For starters, I tested out my own phrases and terms in the code demonstrating tracery grammar. It went well as I understood that I can provide two different ‘origin’ phrases and utilize modifiers such as capitalize for a certain one. Based on the example from Generative Design, I incorporated the text being placed onto the canvas from the mouse’s position periodically. I also cleaned up the program to have fewer lines of code. I included a function to clear the canvas when pressing the mouse, since the canvas is getting cluttered by the constant printing of text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I decided to add random colors to each phrase whenever it’s printed for some flavor. Again, basing off of the example from the Generative Design site, I included a function where, if the user presses and holds the mouse while dragging it around, traversal grammar phrases will be printed along the position of the mouse.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I contributed to the creation of this experiment with the help of the two examples above. I wanted to tinker with the idea of using tracery grammar with fun phrases to make (in this case it’s fast food slogans) while incorporating user interaction. Having random phrases popping out from the mouse was a neat idea to incorporate. The only roadblock I experienced was having these phrases spawn in intervals rather than in every frame, but I found out having an if statement with the frame count modulo an integer solves this issue. Another nice add-on I liked was implementing randomness to the color of the phrases printed to make it more livelier. The different colors also makes the piece look like it is made of different layers when overlapping new and old phrases.</p>
