			<h1>Experiment 1 - Getting Started</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Task 1: Read the Syllabus</h2>
				<p>Read the syllabus. There's important (and atypical) information in there that will help you in the class. It's posted here on Canvas. Take the Syllabus Acknowledgement Quiz.</p>
				<p>I have read the syllabus and taken the acknowledgement test.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Task 2: Join the Class Discord Server</h2>
				<p>We want to build a community of programmers and peers. We want to get to know you as part of that community. We're using Discord to keep in touch with one another.</p>
				<p>I have joined the class Discord Server and posted my introductions</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Task 3: Read the Experiment Submission Requirements </h2>
				<p>Every experiment will all take a similar form (this one is an exception and a little different). Read the Experiment Submission Requirements. Experiment reports that are missing elements will be returned to you for resubmission.</p>
				<p>I have read the Experiment Submission Requirements and understand the format needed to submit documents for each experiment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Task 4: Install Software</h2>
				<p>Install all the software you'll need for the courses.</p>
				<p>I have installed the softwares needed for the course.</p>

				<h2>Task 5: Create Your Own Repo</h2>
				<p>I have made my own repo by using the course template.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Task 6: Self-Evaluation Rubic</h2>
				<p>For each assignment, I'm going to ask you to evaluate your own performance. How did you do? Did you understand the material, or are you struggling with it? Did you lean on your partner or were you mostly helping them or did you work together as equal partners? Your honesty here will help you evaluate what you learned. We'll also be looking at your narrative summary of your effort to get a sense of how you are doing. The self-evaluation rubric can be found in course modules under Essential Information on Canvas.</p>
				<p>Complete the self-evaluation rubric for this assignment and include it at the end of your submission.</p>
				<p>I have completed the self-evaluation rubric and attached it to a document of this experiment on Canvas.</p>
