			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I found a piece from the Generative Design site as I like the simple effect of the square changing its size and color based on the mouse position over the screen. I also want more interaction with the user and came across a p5.js reference of mouseIsPressed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I incorporated both examples into my work space and see what they look like in the same canvas. The colors and square size (y-axis) are affected ny the mouse's position while the background also changes color. After making adjustments, I was able to incorporate line strokes on the screen, but with cost of no background colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>At first I tried having more shapes appear when the mouse is pressed that can also have their color changed based on the mouse position, but, as the background has a similar affect to the square's changing color, it overtakes the new shape. For experimentation, I made the background color to white in the setup, have the color fill for the rectangle be based on the mouse position, and have rectangles placed wherever the mouse is. The results reminds me of a real-life painting on a canvas. For some final touches, I included a random chance to have rectangles or ellipses be placed on the canvas and to have the canvas be reset from a click with a color depending on the mouse position.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<p>For this project, I worked on all of the code with myself with the example from Generative Design site and a reference from p5.js as mentioned in the Imitate phase.</p>
					<p>I felt like my work is a good start to this course and what I can expect from the work process in future experiments. I try to not focus too much on choosing a piece to reference and be hung up on reading complicated code. My example was both easy to read and understand where I can base off my original creation. The hardest part for me was the beginning of having to think about what I should create. Having to spend a lot of time finding a reference was tedious, but I was eventually able to find one and learned about the process in choosing the right one. Despite those hard parts, I did have fun having to learn more about p5.js by editing code segments of the example that would lead to my creation. Having that simple interaction with clicking the mouse to affect the whole screen felt remarkable. I really want to continue understanding more of p5.js and how I can project my creativity.</p>
